# Translating from FZC PHP ladders to FZC Django charts/ladders.
#
# `charts` entries are structured based on the FZC Django chart structure.
# The innermost `charts` elements indicate the FZC PHP cup ids and course ids;
# for example, 2-4 means cup 2, course 4.
#
# FZC PHP saves times in milliseconds, even for games with centiseconds. So
# the value needs to be divided by 10 to get centiseconds. That's what the
# `value_divisor` is for in `record_types`.
